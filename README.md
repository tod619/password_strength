# password_strength

## Description

A simple app that tests the length of the users password. The webpage has a blurry background image and as the user types in their password the background image becomes less and less blurry the longer the users password is until the image becomes fully visible. Thei project also uses the Tailwind css framework for the styling of the form and the form elements.

## Demo
